# Cycle 003 Design-Partner Pilot Plan (3 Paid Pilots)

## Commercial Terms (Enforced)
- Onboarding fee: **`$2,000`** (paid before first live questionnaire).
- Monthly subscription: **`$1,800/mo`**.
- Included volume: **12 questionnaires/month**.
- Overage: **`$150`** per questionnaire above 12.
- No discounts below this floor in Cycle 003.

## Ideal Pilot Profile
- B2B SaaS, 20-200 employees, active enterprise sales motions.
- At least 2 active security reviews in pipeline now.
- Buyer can commit budget in <14 days.
- Will provide source documents and reviewer access in week 1.

## 7-Day Pilot Acquisition Sprint

## Day 1-2: Target List + Outreach
- Build list of 30 named ICP accounts from:
  - founder/exec network,
  - warm intros via fractional CISOs,
  - LinkedIn outbound to CTO/Head of Security/Solutions Engineering.
- Send 30 personalized messages with one CTA: 20-minute qualification call.
- Goal: 10 call acceptances.

## Day 3-4: Qualification + Paid Offer
- Run 12 qualification calls.
- Qualify on:
  - questionnaire backlog,
  - active deal urgency,
  - decision owner and procurement path.
- Send 6 proposals with fixed pricing and SLA:
  - first questionnaire turnaround target <=48 hours after complete intake.

## Day 5-7: Close + Onboard
- Close 3 pilots with signed order form + paid onboarding invoice.
- Run live kickoff for each pilot:
  - evidence collection checklist,
  - reviewer assignment,
  - first questionnaire selected.

## Call Script (Short)
1. Confirm current questionnaire volume and deal impact.
2. Quantify current internal completion time and bottlenecks.
3. Explain workflow guarantees:
   - source-grounded drafts,
   - no uncited exports,
   - mandatory human approval.
4. Present fixed paid pilot terms (no unpaid pilot).
5. Close on kickoff date and invoice timing.

## Operational SLA for Pilots
- First draft delivered within `<=6 hours` of complete intake for standard forms.
- Approved export package delivered within `<=48 hours` (assuming customer reviewer responsiveness).
- Daily status updates for active questionnaire until delivery.

## Margin Protection Rules
- Scope control:
  - included: 12 questionnaires/mo standard scope,
  - charge overage immediately after threshold.
- Complexity control:
  - questionnaires with exceptional custom sections trigger scoped addendum or adjusted SLA.
- Labor control:
  - track review minutes and rework loops per account daily.
- Escalation:
  - if account contribution margin <35% in-week, freeze extra requests pending repricing/scope reset.

## Weekly Targets (Cycle 003)
- 30 targeted outbound contacts.
- 12 qualification calls completed.
- 6 paid pilot proposals issued.
- 3 signed + paid pilots.
- >=80% pilot week-1 activation (documents uploaded + first questionnaire started).

## Risks and Countermeasures
- Procurement delay:
  - countermeasure: keep contract simple and invoice onboarding immediately.
- "Can we try free first?":
  - countermeasure: offer short paid pilot only; do not offer free execution.
- Reviewer bottleneck on customer side:
  - countermeasure: require named approver at kickoff and daily escalation path.

## Next Action
Execute Day 1 list build and send first 30 personalized outreach messages before end of day.
