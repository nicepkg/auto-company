# Cycle 001 Brainstorm (Marketing - Godin)

## Idea Name
**Renewal Rescue** - an AI-assisted renewal-at-risk alert and reactivation service for small B2B SaaS teams.

## ICP
Founder-led B2B SaaS companies (MRR: $10k-$150k, team size: 1-10) using Stripe, with no dedicated lifecycle marketer and rising logo churn.

## Problem
These teams lose renewals because nobody consistently monitors risk signals (declining usage, failed payments, inactivity, support friction) and triggers the right save playbook in time. Revenue leaks quietly every month.

## MVP in 7 Days
- Connect Stripe + one product event source (CSV upload or PostHog export).
- Generate a weekly "At-Risk Accounts" report with top 20 accounts and reason tags.
- Provide 3 one-click retention email drafts per account (founder voice, CSM voice, urgent save offer).
- Send report by email every Monday with a simple action checklist.
- Manual concierge layer behind the scenes for reliability and speed.

## GTM First Channel
Founder-led outbound to SaaS operators on LinkedIn + warm communities (Indie Hackers, MicroConf Slack):
- Offer: "I’ll find your top 20 likely churn risks this week and draft save emails in 48 hours."
- CTA: paid pilot, not waitlist.

## Pricing Hypothesis
- Pilot: **$399 setup + $299/month** for up to 500 active customers.
- Value story: saving one $99-$499 MRR account can pay for the service many times over.
- Expansion trigger: move to $599-$999/month when automated integrations and weekly score accuracy improve.

## Key Risk
Retention risk scoring may feel "noisy" in early data, reducing trust; if first reports produce weak saves, churned trust kills referrals.

## Next Action
Recruit 5 founder-led SaaS pilots this week and deliver their first at-risk report within 48 hours to capture proof and testimonials.
