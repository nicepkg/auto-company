# Cycle 003 CTO Pilot Plan - 3 Paid Design Partners

## Commercial Guardrails (Non-Negotiable)
- Pricing floor enforced in every quote/order form:
  - `$2,000` onboarding (one-time)
  - `$1,800/mo` includes `12` questionnaires
  - `$150` overage per questionnaire above `12`
- No free pilots.
- No custom integration work in pilot scope unless separately paid.

## Pilot ICP and Qualification
- B2B SaaS, `20-200` employees, active enterprise deals.
- Current pain: at least `4` questionnaires/month and at least one blocked deal.
- Must provide:
  - prior completed questionnaires
  - current security policies/evidence
  - named approver (security/engineering lead).

Disqualify if:
- wants fully autonomous submission without human approval.
- refuses pricing floor.
- cannot provide usable source documents.

## 14-Day Action Plan to Close 3 Pilots

### Days 1-2: Target List + Outreach Packet
1. Build list of `30` target accounts from founder network and existing pipeline.
2. Prepare standard pilot packet:
   - one-page architecture and control gates summary
   - sample redlined questionnaire output with citations
   - pricing and scope sheet.

### Days 3-5: Technical Discovery Calls (10 Calls)
1. Run `45-minute` technical discovery:
   - questionnaire volume, formats, SLA needs, risk controls.
2. Complete standardized readiness scorecard per account.
3. Advance only accounts scoring `>=70/100` readiness.

### Days 6-9: Pilot Scoping + Order Form
1. Issue fixed-scope pilot statement:
   - includes explicit `G1/G2` controls and customer final-signoff responsibility.
2. Send order form with pricing floor and overage terms.
3. Collect onboarding invoice payment before implementation start.

### Days 10-14: Onboarding and First Questionnaire
1. Provision workspace and ingest docs within `24h` of payment.
2. Complete first live questionnaire draft in `48h`.
3. Capture baseline metrics:
   - turnaround time delta
   - reviewer edits per questionnaire
   - contribution margin proxy.

## Margin Protection Controls During Pilots
- `M1`: reviewer time cap target = `<=15 min` per questionnaire section median.
- `M2`: pilot account requiring persistent manual effort above cap for 2 weeks triggers scope reduction or repricing.
- `M3`: no pilot gets custom work beyond agreed template set without change order.
- `M4`: weekly contribution report per pilot:
  - revenue booked
  - variable cost estimate
  - projected gross margin.

## Pilot Dashboard Metrics (Weekly)
- `Closed pilots`: target `3`
- `Paid onboarding collected`: target `100%` before start
- `Citation coverage`: target `100%`
- `Approval compliance`: target `100%` exports with full approval trail
- `Median turnaround`: target `>=50%` faster than customer baseline
- `Contribution margin`: target `>=60%` per pilot account

## Exact Files to Create/Modify (Sales + Delivery Enablement)
- `docs/sales/cycle-003-design-partner-outreach-list.md`
- `docs/sales/cycle-003-pilot-order-form-template.md`
- `docs/sales/cycle-003-discovery-scorecard.md`
- `docs/operations/cycle-003-pilot-onboarding-checklist.md`

- `docs/qa/cycle-003-gate-compliance-checklist.md`
- `projects/security-questionnaire-autopilot/docs/customer-onboarding-runbook.md`

## Next Action
Sales + Operations should start outreach to 30 targets now and schedule the first 5 technical discovery calls within 48 hours using the fixed pricing floor.
