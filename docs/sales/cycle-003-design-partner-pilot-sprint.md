# Cycle 003 Design-Partner Pilot Sprint (14 Days)

## Objective
Close `3 paid design-partner pilots` for Security Questionnaire Autopilot at locked terms:
- `$2,000` onboarding
- `$1,800/mo` includes 12 questionnaires
- `$150` overage

Do not close deals that violate pricing floor or quality gates.

## Day-by-Day Execution
1. Day 1:
   - Build `100-account` list (ICP: B2B SaaS with enterprise sales motion).
   - Segment: 20 warm, 80 outbound.
   - Finalize pilot one-pager and proposal template.
2. Day 2:
   - Send first-wave outreach to all warm accounts + first 40 outbound.
   - Book calls into Days 3-6.
3. Day 3:
   - Run `4-6` discovery calls.
   - Qualify against questionnaire volume, budget owner, urgency, and approval-process fit.
4. Day 4:
   - Send same-day tailored proposals to qualified opportunities.
   - Push for signature + onboarding payment in `<= 5 business days`.
5. Day 5:
   - Second-wave outreach to remaining outbound accounts.
   - Follow-up sequence to non-responders from Days 1-2.
6. Day 6:
   - Run second block of discovery calls.

7. Day 7:
   - Close first pilot.
   - Kickoff date and approver name locked in writing.
8. Day 8:
   - Follow-up + objection handling block.

10. Day 10:
    - Final outbound burst using referral and partner channels.
    - Ask each active opportunity for 1 internal stakeholder intro.
11. Day 11:
    - Final proposal revisions (scope/SLA only, no price concessions).
12. Day 12:
    - Close third pilot.
13. Day 13:
    - Confirm kickoff checklist for all 3 pilots.
14. Day 14:
    - Publish pipeline + conversion report and handoff to delivery.

## Qualification Rubric (Use in Discovery)
Required:
- Active security questionnaire pain tied to live revenue deals.
- Questionnaire load supports ROI (`>= 8 per quarter`).
- Willingness to operate with mandatory human approval flow.
- Budget authority or clear sponsor with procurement path.

Disqualify if:
- Wants autonomous submission with no human approval.
- Demands discounts below pricing floor.
- Has <4 questionnaires/quarter and no expansion signal.

## Objection Handling Scripts
`"Price is too high"`
- "If we remove one delayed enterprise deal by accelerating security responses, the fee is typically recovered in one cycle. We can tune SLA and onboarding scope, but we do not discount below the pilot floor."

`"Why not use existing GRC tooling?"`
- "This is outcome-focused: source-grounded draft answers, mandatory human approval, and export package reliability under deadlines. We fit into your current stack and clear backlog now."

`"Can AI submit directly?"`
- "No. Human approval is mandatory by design. It protects your team and is a hard requirement of the pilot."

## Contract and Proposal Guardrails
- Include explicit statement: customer approver owns final submission decision.
- Include deliverable statement: every answer includes citation evidence.
- Include operational limits: included volume is 12 questionnaires/month; overage billed at `$150`.
- Include margin-protection clause: scope repricing or timeline adjustment applies for non-standard/custom questionnaires that exceed agreed reviewer effort.

## Weekly Cadence
- Monday: pipeline review (inputs/process/output KPIs)
- Wednesday: pricing discipline review (discount requests + losses)
- Friday: delivery-quality review with ops (citation coverage, approval compliance, reviewer time)

## Deliverables Produced This Sprint
1. `3 signed pilot agreements` with onboarding fee collected.
2. `3 kickoff plans` with named approvers and SLA dates.
3. `Pipeline report` with stage-by-stage conversion and blockers.

## Next Action
Start Day 1 now: load 100 accounts into `docs/sales/cycle-003-pipeline-tracker.csv` and send first 20 warm intro requests today.
