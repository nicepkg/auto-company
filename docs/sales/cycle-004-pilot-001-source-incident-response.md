# Incident Response and Vulnerability Management

Critical vulnerabilities on internet-facing systems are remediated within 72 hours, with executive escalation at 48 hours.
The incident response plan is tested at least twice per year through cross-functional tabletop exercises.
Tabletop participants include Security, Engineering, Legal, and Customer Success incident coordinators.
Security event monitoring is continuous and on-call responders are paged for high severity detections.
