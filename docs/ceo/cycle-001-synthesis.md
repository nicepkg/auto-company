# Cycle 001 Team Synthesis

## Candidate Ideas
1. AfterHours Revenue Desk (ceo-bezos)
2. QuoteClarity for Home Services (product-norman)
3. Security Questionnaire Autopilot for B2B SaaS (cto-vogels)
4. Renewal Rescue for small B2B SaaS (marketing-godin)
5. LoopWatch Audit (research-thompson)

## Ranking (Top 3)
1. **Security Questionnaire Autopilot for B2B SaaS**
2. **AfterHours Revenue Desk**
3. **LoopWatch Audit**

## Why This Ranking
- #1 wins on immediate willingness-to-pay (clear enterprise pain, high ACV, expensive manual workflow today) and straightforward pilot conversion.
- #2 has strong local-business ROI clarity and short path to pilots, but voice handling quality/risk is harder operationally in week 1.
- #3 has strongest build-distribution fit with current repo capabilities, but buyer segment is earlier and narrower than #1.

## Conflicts Resolved
- **Home services vs B2B SaaS focus:** chose B2B SaaS first because pricing power and urgency are higher for questionnaire bottlenecks.
- **Productized service vs software-first:** chose service-assisted MVP (human approval + citations) to reduce liability while proving demand.
- **Broad retention tooling vs narrow urgent wedge:** selected the narrower, acute workflow where delay directly blocks revenue.

## Owner
- **Owner:** `cto-vogels` (build + pilot delivery), with support from `ceo-bezos` for founder-led sales.

## Immediate Next Action
Run Cycle #2 evaluation of idea #1 with `critic-munger` pre-mortem, `research-thompson` market validation, and `cfo-campbell` unit economics to return **GO / NO-GO**.
