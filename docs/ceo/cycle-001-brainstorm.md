# Cycle 001 Brainstorm - CEO (Jeff Bezos Lens)

## Customer and Core Problem
**Customer (ICP):** US local home-service companies (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, roofing) with 5-30 field technicians, 300+ inbound calls/month, and owner-led dispatch.

**Core problem:** They miss high-intent calls after hours and during peak jobs. Every missed call is a lost booking, and current options (voicemail or generic answering services) convert poorly and give weak lead data.

## Strategic Judgment and Priority
**Idea name:** AfterHours Revenue Desk

**Strategic judgment:** This is a two-way-door decision with fast path to cash. We can ship in a week, sell before perfection, and learn from real booking outcomes. It compounds: better call handling -> more booked jobs -> clearer ROI proof -> easier sales -> more vertical-specific training data -> better conversion.

**Priority order:** #1 immediate bet for Cycle 001 because it is narrowly scoped, urgent for buyers, and tied directly to revenue outcomes.

## MVP in 7 Days
1. Provision business number and call forwarding.
2. AI voice flow for missed/after-hours calls: capture name, job type, ZIP, urgency.
3. Instant SMS to caller with confirmation + booking link.
4. Instant SMS/Slack alert to owner/dispatcher with structured lead summary.
5. Daily "recovered jobs" report (calls handled, qualified leads, estimated revenue).
6. Basic dashboard with call logs and transcripts.
7. Manual onboarding playbook (white-glove setup in <24 hours).

## GTM First Channel
**First channel:** Founder-led outbound to local service businesses from Google Maps + direct calls.

**Offer:** "7-day missed-call recovery pilot" with setup in one day and a simple ROI promise (if no qualified leads recovered, no monthly fee).

## Pricing Hypothesis
- $399/month base (includes up to 200 handled minutes)
- $0.35/min overage
- $500 setup fee (waived for first 10 customers to accelerate references)

Rationale: priced below one lost mid-ticket job; easy yes if we recover even 1-2 jobs/month.

## Key Risk and Decision Type
**Key risk:** Trust risk from incorrect call handling (bad lead qualification or wrong urgency handling) could damage customer relationships quickly.

**Irreversible vs reversible:**
- Reversible: pricing, scripts, onboarding process, vertical focus.
- Harder-to-reverse: brand promise around "fully autonomous" handling before quality is proven.

## Next Action
Product + GTM: write a 1-page PR/FAQ tomorrow morning, then recruit 3 design partners by direct outreach and start paid pilots this week.
