# Cycle 002 GO/NO-GO Decision

## Decision
**GO (conditional) on Security Questionnaire Autopilot for B2B SaaS.**

## Why
- Pre-mortem supports proceeding only with strict risk gates (`docs/critic/cycle-002-premortem.md`).
- Market validation confirms demand and timing but warns of incumbent pressure (`docs/research/cycle-002-market-validation.md`).
- Unit economics are viable only after repricing (`docs/cfo/cycle-002-unit-economics.md`).

## Mandatory Gates
1. Pricing: enforce `>= $1,500 MRR` floor (target `$2,000 onboarding + $1,800/mo + $150 overage`).
2. Quality: citation-first answers, mandatory human approval, high-risk control escalation.
3. Economics: stop expansion if contribution margin is negative after 5 paid pilots.

## Next Action
Cycle #3 starts immediately: ship code for MVP workflow and close 3 paid design-partner pilots this cycle.
